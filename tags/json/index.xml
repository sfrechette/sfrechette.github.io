      <description>Finally the 2017-2018 NHL hockey season has begun! But wait… **PANIC** my little thingy nhlplaybyplay-node for fetching games and play-by-play does not work anymore… Hmmm, after some research it looked like I needed to do some updates and fixes in order to make it work again… Instead I decided to create another Node.js app nhlplaybyplay2-node.
The following is a mirrored post from the README.md on the Github repo -&amp;gt; https://github.</description>

      <description>In support of an earlier post Fetching NHL Play by Play game data, I was recently asked how could one quickly search for a specific string in multiple JSON files recursively? Well if you are running macOS or Linux grep is your best friend! In a nutshell grep prints lines that contain a match for a pattern. The following is a sample grep and cut command that will list out (output) the games (files) that contains the following string -&amp;gt; “Montréal Canadiens”:</description>

      <description>Following-up from a previous post Fetching NHL Play by Play game data where I created a Node.js app that enabled the fetching of NHL Play by Play JSON game files. The next step was to enable the parsing of JSON files into CSV files in order to do some further exploring… say like analyzing with R, load into a RDBMS, or visualizing it!
So I added a new javascript file convert.</description>

      <description>Fetching NHL Play by Play game data I created a Node.js application called nhlplaybyplay-nodethat provides the means for accessing, fetching the NHL Schedule and Play by Play game data files which are in JSON format.
Hope your familiar with this…
