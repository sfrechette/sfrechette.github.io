      <description>Yes this is my first blog post using Hugo. Finally decided to venture out of my comfort zone and try some new things this year. So done with Wordpress (thank you for all these years), I have decided to import selected posts from my old blog&amp;hellip;
So what to expect? Well basically rants, lessons learned either from the field or from my personnal life, and most importantly about technology, cloud computing and dev stuff.</description>

      <description>Hope you are all enjoying summer? Been asked several times, How do I keep current with technology? What blogs do you read or follow? Which podcasts do you follow and listen to? So I have quickly put together a list of resources, more specifically podcasts, blogs that I consume regularly&amp;#8230; This is no way a definitive list üòâ and in no particular order! Of course these are related to Data Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</description>
