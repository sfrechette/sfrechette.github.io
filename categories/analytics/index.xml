      <description>I was recently asked to provide a simple demo/proof-of-concept on how to quickly create a real-time streaming dashboard with Power BI. Did you know that you can stream data and update dashboards in real-time? Any visual or dashboard that can be created in Power BI can also be created to display and update real-time data and visuals. The devices and sources of streaming data can be factory sensors, social media sources, service usage metrics, and anything else from which time-sensitive data can be collected or transmitted.</description>

      <description>In-memory distributed processing for large datasets&amp;#8230; How to connect to SQL Server using Apache Spark? The Spark documentation covers the basics of the API and Dataframes, there is a lack of info. and examples on actually how to get this feature to work.
    First, what is Apache Spark? Apache Spark is an open source big data processing framework built around speed, ease of use, and sophisticated analytics.</description>

      <description>A short tale of&amp;#8230; data vizes. It&amp;#8217;s about Tableau, R, and Shiny. How to prepare/build an existing and well-known Tableau visualization with R and provide web analysis interactivity. Will be using the raw data from the sample workbook named &amp;#8220;Regional&amp;#8221; that comes with Tableau Desktop. The following image below is a snapshot of the visualization that we will try to reproduce with R. You can also view and interact with this visualization on my Tableau Public profile page -&amp;gt; http://tabsoft.</description>

      <description>The more you used it, the more you discover great stuff&amp;#8230; I wanted to do some analysis with some weather data, but did not want to start searching and scraping sites, then merging and cleansing&amp;#8230;you know the drill. So I came across this neat R package named weatherData. weatherData provides functions that help in fetching weather data from websites, documentation found here -&amp;gt; https://ram-n.github.io/weatherData/.
So I got inspired to compare Ottawa weather and Ottawa JavaScript Meetup attendance!</description>

      <description>First Happy New Year and best wishes for 2015!

Hence that&amp;#8217;s why I registered and currently more than half way through the Data Science Specialization on Coursera from the Johns Hopkins University.
