      <description>Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. Running a SQL Server database on Kubernetes is a topic of discussion nowadays as Kubernetes provides ways to provision stateful containers using persistent volumes, statefulsets, etc.
The following post is a tutorial we recently published on Google’s Partner Solutions that demonstrates how to provision a single instance of SQL Server 2017 on Linux on GKE using Regional persistent disks.</description>

      <description>Installing TimescaleDB on Azure. First some housekeeping… A time series database is a software system that is optimized for handling time series data, arrays of numbers indexed by time (a datetime or a datetime range). In some fields these time series are called profiles, curves, or traces.
  Lately I discovered TimescaleDB, an open source time-series database engineered up from PostgreSQL and packaged as an extension. It is optimized for fast ingest and complex queries.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked to provide a simple demo/proof-of-concept on how to quickly create a real-time streaming dashboard with Power BI. Did you know that you can stream data and update dashboards in real-time? Any visual or dashboard that can be created in Power BI can also be created to display and update real-time data and visuals. The devices and sources of streaming data can be factory sensors, social media sources, service usage metrics, and anything else from which time-sensitive data can be collected or transmitted.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned several times before… Graphs are everywhere! Graph features are being introduced in SQL Server 2017. Offering graph database capabilities to model many-to-many relationships. The graph relationships are integrated into Transact-SQL and receive the benefits of using SQL Server as the foundational database management system.
What is a graph database? In context, a graph database is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges and properties to represent and store data.</description>

      <description>What is Docker? Dockeris an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data centers, VMs, or in the cloud. Docker allows applications to be isolated into containers with instructions for exactly what they need to survive that can be easily ported from machine to machine. Though Virtual machines also allow the exact same thing, and numerous other tools already exist to make rebuilding these configurations portable and reproducible, Docker has a more simplified structure compared to both of these, the real area where it causes disruption is resource efficiency.</description>

Row-Level Security enables customers to control access to rows in a database table based on the characteristics of the user executing a query (e.g., group membership or execution context).</description>

      <description>With SQL Server 2016 just around the corner, a series of new features and enhancements will be introduced. More specifically some important Security Upgrades; Always Encrypted, Row Level Security, and Dynamic Data Masking. This post covers SQL Server 2016 – Dynamic Data Masking (DDM).
Note: DDM is also available in Azure SQL Database see the following link for details -&amp;gt; http://bit.ly/1eG7Que
  What is Dynamic Data Masking? Dynamic Data Masking enables you to anonymize sensitive data, real-time obfuscation of data to prevent unauthorized access by controlling how the data appears in the output of database queries.</description>

      <description>A short tale of… data vizes. It’s about Tableau, R, and Shiny. How to prepare/build an existing and well-known Tableau visualization with R and provide web analysis interactivity. Will be using the raw data from the sample workbook named “Regional” that comes with Tableau Desktop. The following image below is a snapshot of the visualization that we will try to reproduce with R. You can also view and interact with this visualization on my Tableau Public profile page -&amp;gt; http://tabsoft.</description>

      <description>Yes another exploration and exercise on graph modeling. This time about something I often use… the Cloud: Microsoft Azure. Thought it would be interesting to model the available Azure Cloud Service offerings by category, region, and location. The inspiration and data comes from the following source of information on the following web page http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/#services. A trivial one, but useful for demonstrating and understanding concepts. This is also a great example of how to store master data and discover new insights in existing data.</description>

      <description>A quick exercise on graph modeling. I recently got inspired from one of Nicole White’spost who did something similar with the Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW) data. So I decided to create a Neo4j graph database of the shopping places (boutiques, restaurants and services)at the Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport (YUL). There isn’t any raw data to download on the site. So I will spare you the details of my scrapping efforts and instead share with you my findings and results.</description>

      <description>Graphs are everywhere! In my efforts to spread the word and inform SQL Server Professionals about Neo4j and learn how to take a relational database schema and model it as a graph… AdventureWorks was a no-brainer! Let’s explore how to import a subset of the AdventureWorks database from SQL Server (RDBMS) into Neo4j (GraphDB).
But first some prerequisites. You should at least have a basic understanding of what is a property graph modeland have completed the following modeling guidelines.</description>

      <description>The more you used it, the more you discover great stuff… I wanted to do some analysis with some weather data, but did not want to start searching and scraping sites, then merging and cleansing…you know the drill. So I came across this neat R package named weatherData. weatherData provides functions that help in fetching weather data from websites, documentation found here -&amp;gt; https://ram-n.github.io/weatherData/.
So I got inspired to compare Ottawa weather and Ottawa JavaScript Meetup attendance!</description>

      <description>First Happy New Year and best wishes for 2015!
Yes, Data Analytics with R and SQL Server … As Data and Business Intelligence Architects I personally think we just can’t dismiss or push aside the Data Science “landscape”. Hence that’s why I registered and currently more than half way through the Data Science Specialization on Courserafrom the Johns Hopkins University. Even though I have been working with R for a while I wanted to get some kind of recognition, attestation for my skills and also just because I can 😉</description>

      <description>You are new or quite interested in exploring Graph Databases and would like to know how to start modeling and importing data in Neo4j?
There are several ways that could get you started; the neo4j-shell-tools, Load CSV and Batch Importand many more. I strongly recommend reading and exploring the following resources, but to quickly get you started modeling and easily import a small subset of data (&amp;lt;1000 nodes/relationships) the spreadsheet approach is well suited for this.</description>
